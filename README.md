# echo-chamber

Based off of the Feather theme by Eric Hu

- post size slightly bigger
- tags visible (either below or to the side)
- switch arrow icon to something else (need to brainstorm), easier to see and closer to the posts
- menu bar (about, 2-3 different tag categories)
- infinite scroll

## Timeline

- 11/25/2019: figured out how to make tags visible as well as how to change the arrow icon. Looks like we are going to need CSS Grid to properly align the tags, arrow, date, as well as notes to the right side of the left-aligned column where all the content is

------------|  arrow?
------------|   date?
------------|  notes?
------------|   tags?

Something to consider...need to make the tags stagger nicely (even if Yvonne did say that she will have like, 4 tags max)
